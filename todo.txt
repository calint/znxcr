[x] zn
[x]   at 'call' after push reset zn
[x] op 'copy'
[x] solve "ifX [op] next return"
[ ] op 'skip' signed value
[ ] refactor operations encoding to align op with alu-op
[o] review racing conditions
        simulation in vivado works correctly but not in iverilog
        because the 'always(posedge clk)' blocks are called in
        different order
        assume that the fpga layout of components are the same
        as in the simulator and racing does not occur

[x]   Control.pc vs CallStack, LoopStack
[x]   CallStack.(pc_out, zf_out, nf_out) vs Control
[ ]   Control vs LoopStack
[o] review non-blocking assignments vs blocking assignments
[ ] emulator
[ ] assembler
