Blocking assignment executes "in series" because a blocking assignment blocks 
execution of the next statement until it completes. Therefore the results of 
the next statement may depend on the first one being completed.

Non-blocking assignment executes in parallel because it describes assignments 
that all occur at the same time. The result of a statement on the 2nd line 
will not depend on the results of the statement on the 1st line. Instead, the 
2nd line will execute as if the 1st line had not happened yet.
