Blocking assignment executes "in series" because a blocking assignment blocks 
execution of the next statement until it completes. Therefore the results of 
the next statement may depend on the first one being completed.

Non-blocking assignment executes in parallel because it describes assignments 
that all occur at the same time. The result of a statement on the 2nd line 
will not depend on the results of the statement on the 1st line. Instead, the 
2nd line will execute as if the 1st line had not happened yet.

Nonblocking Assignments in Verilog Synthesis, Coding
Styles That Kill!
Clifford E. Cummings

5.0 Verilog coding guidelines
Guideline #1: When modeling sequential logic, use nonblocking assignments.
Guideline #2: When modeling latches, use nonblocking assignments.
Guideline #3: When modeling combinational logic with an always block, use blocking
assignments.
Guideline #4: When modeling both sequential and combinational logic within the same always
block, use nonblocking assignments.
Guideline #5: Do not mix blocking and nonblocking assignments in the same always block.
Guideline #6: Do not make assignments to the same variable from more than one always block.
Guideline #7: Use $strobe to display values that have been assigned using nonblocking
assignments.
Guideline #8: Do not make assignments using #0 delays.
